# thefirstgame
This is my first python game.
This is inspired by space inventor game. 
I have used pygame library.
I have imported random in this game.
You just have to run this code in python editor to enjoy the game.
You can kill "Angryman" with the space button by firing a bullet.
You can also move "Happyman" with Left-Right key.
